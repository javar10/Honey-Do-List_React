# Honey-Do List

Users can collaborate on a shared task list. They can add, assign, and then accept or decline tasks. 
Points are awarded for task completion and are based on difficulty of task and time needed to complete task. 
Tasks are automatically assigned if noone accepts them. Points can then be redeemed to decline an auto-assignment.
